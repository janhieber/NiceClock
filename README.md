This is for testing the new KiCad v4.

I startet a design with KiCad, learned how it works.  
KiCad has some nice features and works really great.  
But on the other side it has some limitations or things not implemented yet.

What holds me from finishing this in KiCad is the
drawing of the bars between 5 minutes.

In KiCad the only chance is to draw a track with rounded edges and diffucult
align it with an 30° angle, with some helper lines etc... really ugly to do.

In Eagle it's a bit better, because i can draw a rectangle, turn it to 30° or 60°.
Now also with some helper lines and circles (which are much easier to handle in Eagle that KiCad)
i can align the rectangles with a small grid.
I can also copy them to remove solder mask at that position.

In KiCad selecting stuff is messy and moving things around is ugly.
