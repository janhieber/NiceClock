This project was started for testing the new KiCad v4
as a replacement for EAGLE.

I want a free ECAD software without the limiations, so
I started this to explore the capabilities of KiCad.

Conclusion: KiCad can be a good replacement for EAGLE and co.  
It has some rough edges, but therefore makes a point with other
great features.

If you are interessted in this, feel free to contact me.  
I'll also have some spare PCBs when i ordner them, so I'll sell them.
